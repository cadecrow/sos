# Machine learning model that classifies any food as a soup, salad, or a sandwhich !!!

If you have never heard of the game, basically there is theory that you can classify any food as a soup, salad or sandwhich. Then you can argue with your friends over who is right and wrong.
Just think about it. What are nachos? They are totally a salad! well... they do have some soupy qualities </br>

If you don't believe me when I say this a real game that people play, please refer to: </br>
